# Japanese Lucky Day Calendar
## Based on the Calendar Reader for Alexa Skill Template

To introduce another way to help you build useful and meaningful skills for Alexa quickly, we’ve launched a calendar reader skill template. This new Alexa skill template makes it easy for developers to create a skill like an “Event Calendar,” or “Community Calendar,” etc. The template leverages [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), the [Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit), and the [Alexa SDK for Node.js](https://developer.amazon.com/public/community/post/Tx213D2XQIYH864/Announcing-the-Alexa-Skills-Kit-for-Node-js), while providing the business logic, use cases, error handling and help functions for your skill. 

For this tutorial, we'll be working with the calendar from Stanford University.  The user of this skill will be able to ask things like:

   * "What is happening tonight?
   * "What events are going on next Monday?"
   * "Tell me more about the second event."

You will be able to plug your own public calendar feed (an .ICS file) into the sample provided, so that you can interact with your calendar in the same way. This could be useful for small businesses, community leaders, event planners, realtors, or anyone that wants to share a calendar with their audience.
